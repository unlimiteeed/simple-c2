# Golang C2 Command Sender

🚀 This is a simple Golang Command and Control (C2) tool designed to send commands and receive results. It's implemented solely in Golang without any additional features.

## Installation 
```git clone https://github.com/unlimiteeed/simple-c2.git```

Then we need to build it 

```go build client.go```



## Setup Team Server

Before running the client, you need to set up the team server. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
python3 team-server.py
```
Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

## Team Server Integration
👥 If you have a team server set up, you can integrate this tool to receive commands and send results back to the server. Please refer to the documentation for your team server for integration instructions.
